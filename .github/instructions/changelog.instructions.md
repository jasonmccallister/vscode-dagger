Use the following guidelines to write a clear and concise changelog entry:

1. **Keep it brief**: Aim for a two to three sentence summary of the changes made. Avoid lengthy explanations.
2. **Use clear language**: Avoid jargon and technical terms that may not be familiar to all readers.
3. **Keep it focused on engineers**: Write entries that are relevant to developers and engineers, as they will be the primary audience for the changelog.
4. **Only document worthwhile changes**: Include details about what was changed, added, or fixed, and reference any relevant issues or pull requests.
5. **Use a consistent format**: Follow the established format for changelog entries to maintain readability and organization.
