Use modern TypeScript features and best practices in your code. Here are some guidelines to follow:

1. Use `const` and `let` instead of `var` for variable declarations.
2. Take advantage of TypeScript's type system by using interfaces and types.
3. Use arrow functions for callbacks and methods.
4. Prefer template literals over string concatenation.
5. Use async/await for asynchronous code instead of callbacks or promises.
6. Leverage modern ES features like destructuring, spread/rest operators, and default parameters.
7. Write unit tests for your code using a testing framework Mocha.
8. Follow a consistent coding style and use a linter like ESLint to enforce it.
9. Prefer dependency injection for better testability and modularity.
