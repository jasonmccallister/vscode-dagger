# Dagger for VS Code

The VS Code [Dagger](https://dagger.io) extension provides seemless integration with VS Code and using Dagger.

## Features

### Easily Manage Install

With this extension, you can easily manage installing, upgrading, or uninstalling Dagger from your system, all within VS Code. The extensions will determine your package manager (e.g. Homebrew) and provide options for installation.

### Call Functions using the IDE

You can also call functions, such as running unit tests or building images, directly from VS Code. The extension is smart enough to read all functions, provide them as a list and read function arguments and present them as UI options.
