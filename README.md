## Features

### üå≤ Function Explorer, ‚ö° Execution, and üìù Save as Tasks

These features make Dagger usage powerful and easy to use in VS Code:

- **Functions Explorer:** Browse and execute Dagger functions directly in VS Code. View arguments and details in a tree view.
- **Function Execution:** Run Dagger functions with validated arguments. Output is shown in the integrated terminal.
- **Save as VS Code Tasks:** Convert function calls into reusable tasks. Automatically updates `.vscode/tasks.json`.
